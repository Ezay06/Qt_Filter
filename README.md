# 📸 Baby Photoshop — Image Editing Application

*A Qt-based desktop photo editing tool built for the Winged Dragon competition (FCAI-CU).*

Baby Photoshop is a lightweight image-editing application developed by three students as part of the **Winged Dragon Competition**, supervised by **Dr. Mohammed El-Ramly** at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University.

The application provides a user-friendly interface and a wide collection of image filters and transformations — implemented manually in C++ without external image-processing libraries.
